<p>Building trust: The AI is all about technology, science, and algorithms which mostly people are not aware of, which makes it difficult to put trust on it.</p>
<p>Investment: AI is an very expensive technology that not every business owner can invest money into as large amount of computing power will be necessary and sometimes hardware acceleration with GPU, FPGA, or ASIC must be in place to run machine learning models effectively. Though adoptability of AI is surging high, it has not been integrated fully in businessâ€™s value chain at the scale which it should have. Moreover, enterprises of those who have incorporated are still in nascent stage which have resulted in the slowdown in the lifting of the AI technology at scale and thus been deprived of cost benefit of scale. After decades of speculation and justifiable anxiety about the social implications of intensifying & potentially de-stabilizing AI technology for humankind and Black box problem, AI investors are bit skeptical from parking their money in potential startups.</p>
<p>Non-invincible: (Can replace only certain tasks) Like any other technology, AI also has its own limitations; it simply cannot replace all tasks. However, it will result in emerging new job domain with different quality job profile.</p>
<p>Data security: Machine learning and decision-making capability of AI and AI application are based on huge volumes of classified data, often sensitive and personal in nature. This makes it vulnerable to serious issues like data breach and identity theft. Mostly, companies and government striving for profits and power, respectively, exploit the AI-based tools which are generally globally networked which make them difficult to regulate or rein in.</p>
