        <tr>
          <td>1. Increases work efficiency: The powered machines by AI are great at doing certain tasks with amazing efficiency. The reason of this is that they remove the human errors from their tasks to achieve accurate results every time they do that certain task.</td>
          <td>1. AI is Unsustainable:Intelligent machines have characteristically high computing powers contributed by an array of several processers. These computer chips have rare earth materials like Selenium as a major constituent. Besides, the batteries of such machines run on Lithium, again a rare element in earthâ€™s crust. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Reduce cost of training and operation: The machines powered by AI uses machine learning algorithms like Deep Learning and neural networks just to learn new things like humans do. This way they eliminate the need to write new code every time we need them to learn new things.</td>
          <td>2. It provides lesser jobs:No one can deny that machines the tasks they have to do much better than humans. Many businesses would prefer to have working machines instead of humans to increase their profitability, thus reducing the jobs that are available for the human workforce. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3. AI improves processes:The best part about AI-powered machines being deployed for work is that they let us gather humongous amounts of data related to their work. Such data can be processed to gather deep insights into the processes with quantitative analysis so that we can optimize them even further. </td>
            <td>3. It's a threat to Humanity: Elon Musk is one of the smartest persons working on artificial intelligence in present times. He has also stated publicly that AI is provides the biggest threat to human civilization in the future. This means that the dystopian future that sci-fi movies show is not impossible. Also, Stephen Hawking has always shown his disagreement with the advancement in the field of AI.</td>
