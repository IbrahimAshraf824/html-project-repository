<p>1. AI in Autonomous vehicles: Like humans, the self-driving cars need to have sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect processes and choose the best actions based on information gathered. Autonomous vehicles are with advanced tool to gather information, including long range radar and cameras. Each of the technologies is used in different capacities and each collects different information. This information is useless, unless it is processed and some form of information is taken based on the gathered information. This is where artificial intelligence comes into play and can be compared to human brain.</p>
<p>2. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Most companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known technologies is IBMâ€™s Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked for. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. AI is a study realized to emulate human intelligence into computer technology that could assist both, the doctor and the patients in the following ways:

    <p>-By providing a laboratory for the examination, representation and cataloguing medical information</p>
    <p>-By devising novel tool to support decision making and research</p>
    <p>-By integrating activities in medical, software and cognitive sciences.</p>
    <p>-By offering a content rich discipline for the future scientific medical communities.</p>
<p>3. AI in education: It automates grading, giving educators more time. It can also assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace.</p>
