    Artificial intelligence is the ability of any digital computer or a computer controlled by a robot to perform certain jobs and tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to give reasons, find a meaning, feel, or learn from past experience. Since the progress of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been proved that computers can be programmed to carry out very hard and complex tasks as, for example, giving proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great intelligence and speed. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are no any programs that can match human flexibility yet. But we can see some programs that have attained to perform levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific jobs and tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.
